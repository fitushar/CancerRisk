# CancerRisk

CancerRisk is a repository for developing and evaluating **cancer risk prediction models**.  
It provides data preparation scripts, model training examples, and tutorials demonstrating how to build sparse, interpretable risk score models using clinical and imaging features.

## Features
- End-to-end pipeline for cancer risk prediction.
- Integration with interpretable scoring models (e.g., FasterRisk).
- Example Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation.


## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fitushar/CancerRisk.git
cd CancerRisk
```

## Folder Structure
* **ml_dataset/** – example datasets for model training and testing.
* **FasterRiskTutorial.ipynb** – walkthrough for building risk models.
* **README.md** – project overview.
